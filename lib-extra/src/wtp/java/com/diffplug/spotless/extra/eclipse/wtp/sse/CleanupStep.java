/**
 * Common base class for step implementations based on an SSE cleanup processor.
 * <p>
 * Some WTP formatters do not apply all formatting within a formatter process,
 * but provide a cleanup and a formatter process, whereas the cleanup process
 * calls the formatter process.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Not all cleanup processes provided by WTP are suitable for Spotless formatting.
 * For example the XML cleanup processor focus on syntax and line delimiter
 * corrections. The syntax correction is based on the corresponding XSD/DTD,
 * but it must be assumed by the Spotless formatter that the provided files
 * are valid. It cannot be the purpose of a formatter to correct syntax.
 * A Java formatter should also not attempt to correct compilation errors.
 * A line delimiter correction would furthermore violate the Spotless rule
 * that the strings processed by a Spotless formatter chain must use
 * UNIX style delimiters.
